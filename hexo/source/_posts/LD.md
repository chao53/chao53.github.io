**Project name:** Unstable Reactor

**Date of completion:**  Oct 2, 2021

**Software used:** Unity

**My role:** Solo developer



This is a small game I developed solo within 48 hours for the Ludum Dare game jam in 2021. In the game, players assume the role of a god of inheritance, starting with three basic elements. These elements can be placed into a reaction pool to alter the environment and generate new elements. Various combinations of elements can produce over seventy different derivatives, including humans and modern technological products. I also incorporated many internet memes of the time to make the game more engaging.
