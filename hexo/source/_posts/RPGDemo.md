**Project name:** Massive Crowd Simulation

**Date of completion:**  Aug 16, 2021

**Software used:** Unity

**My role:** Solo developer



When I first started using the Unity, inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, I made a small demo that mimics its combat system. It supports local area network multiplayer battles. I independently completed all gameplay, effects, and networking.
