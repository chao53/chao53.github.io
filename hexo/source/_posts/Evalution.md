During my internship at Tencent, I was involved in the development of a AAA action game demo. In this small team (three members, excluding art outsourcing), I was responsible for designing and implementing the player character's 3Cs, combat systems, and gameplay framework. I developed a tag-based skill system that simplified complexities inherent in traditional state machines, and utilized animation notifies to ensure smooth transitions and combo sequences in character animations. Moreover, I devoted significant effort toward optimizing control responsiveness and animation presentation, including the integration of detailed leg and upper body movements. I also managed the extraction and reproduction of assets from games such as "Tomb Raider," "Monster Hunter," and "Elden Ring" to assist our art team in their production work.
